# X-letâ€™s Atom Combinations for Modeling of OCT Images by Modified Morphological Component Analysis

You can find the datasets used in the paper in the different dataset folders.

In case of using the skin dataset and our codes please cite our paper. 

The other three datasets (or a selection of the data) are barrowed from other papers. The original papers are cited in our paper.
 
There is a review on the non-data-adaptive transforms as a supplimentary section of the paper that can be found on our website and here.
